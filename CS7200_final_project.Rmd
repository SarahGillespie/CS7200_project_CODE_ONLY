# Research Questions
1) Is there a difference in ambulation and upright activity in the first half month of March vs second?

2) Does personalized health coaching make a difference in the first half month of March vs second half? (We hope yes)

3) How much does variability is between participants?

  # different years or worry about inappropriately combining 2021 and 2022 data.
