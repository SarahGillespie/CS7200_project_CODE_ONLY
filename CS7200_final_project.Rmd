# Research Questions
1) Is there a difference in ambulation and upright activity in the first half month of May vs second?

2) Does personalized health coaching make a difference in the first half month of May vs second half? (We hope yes)

3) How much does variability is between participants?

```{r Data Cleaning}
data <- read.csv('data_full.csv')
part_5<- data %>% 
  drop_na(group) %>% # dropped participants who were not in either control or treatment
  mutate(PARTICIPANT = as.factor(PARTICIPANT),
         ambulation_prop = Ambulation/HOURS_COVERAGE,
         upright_prop = Upright..Other. / HOURS_COVERAGE,
         month = as.factor(format(as.Date(DATE, format="%Y-%m-%d"),"%m")),
         day = as.numeric(format(as.Date(DATE), "%d")),
         year = as.numeric(format(as.Date(DATE), "%y")),
         half = as.factor(case_when(day <= 15 ~ 1, TRUE ~ 2)), # split by 1st and 2nd half of month
         half = as.factor(half)) %>% 
  filter(month == "05") %>% # filter to month of May only
  filter(PARTICIPANT != "CR10" | PARTICIPANT != "CR34") %>% # filter out those who did not contribute to the full month?
  select(PARTICIPANT, group, half, year, upright_prop, ambulation_prop, HOURS_COVERAGE)

# # aggregate so there is one value for each participant for each half
part_5_agg <- part_5 %>% 
  group_by(PARTICIPANT, half, group) %>% 
  summarize(mean_upright = mean(upright_prop),
            mean_ambulation = mean(ambulation_prop))
```

## Can we combine 2021 and 2022 May data?

```{r Combination Tests}
part_2021 <- part_5 %>% 
  filter(year == 21)

part_2022 <- part_5 %>% 
  filter(year == 22)

part_trt <- part_5 %>% 
  filter(group == 'Treatment')

part_ctrl <- part_5 %>% 
  filter(group == 'Control')

# Is there a difference in mean activity in May 2021 and 2022?
# test normality to determine non/parametric data
shapiro.test(part_2021$upright_prop) # not normal
shapiro.test(part_2021$ambulation_prop) # not normal
shapiro.test(part_2022$upright_prop) # not normal
shapiro.test(part_2022$ambulation_prop) # not normal

# non-parametric data
wilcox.test(mean(part_2021$upright_prop), mean(part_2022$upright_prop)) # p-value > 0.05
wilcox.test(mean(part_2021$ambulation_prop), mean(part_2022$ambulation_prop)) # p-value > 0.05
# there is not a difference in mean activity

# Is there a difference in contribution in May 2021 and 2022?
shapiro.test(part_2021$HOURS_COVERAGE) # not normal
shapiro.test(part_2022$HOURS_COVERAGE) # not normal

ks.test(part_2021$HOURS_COVERAGE, part_2022$HOURS_COVERAGE) # p-value > 0.05
# there is a difference in contribution
wilcox.test(mean(part_2021$HOURS_COVERAGE), mean(part_2022$HOURS_COVERAGE)) # p-value > 0.05
# alternatively, there is not a difference and we can combine

# Is there a difference in activity distribution in May 2021 and 2022?
ks.test(part_2021$upright_prop, part_2022$upright_prop) # p-value > 0.05
# there is no difference
ks.test(part_2021$ambulation_prop, part_2022$ambulation_prop) # p-value < 0.05
# there is a difference

```

```{r Visualizations}
## We should choose what visualizations are most relevant to our story
# What does the distribution of upright activity look like for each half of the month and by group?

# What does the distribution of ambulation activity look like for each half of the month and by group?

# What does the distribution of upright activity look like for each participant for each half of the month?

# What does the distribution of ambulation activity look like for each participant for each half of the month?
```

```{r Statistical tests to support Visualizations}
# Is there a difference in upright activity between treatment and control in May?
ks.test(part_trt$upright_prop, part_ctrl$upright_prop) # p-value < 0.05
# there is a difference

# Is there a difference in ambulation activity between treatment and control in May?
ks.test(part_trt$ambulation_prop, part_ctrl$ambulation_prop) # p-value < 0.05
# there is a difference
```

```{r Mixed Effects Models and Assumptions}

# ambulation and upright behavior may not be independent
